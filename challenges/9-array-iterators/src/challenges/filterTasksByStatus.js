/**
 * Filter tasks by completion status.
 *
 * Goal: practice `.filter()`.
 *
 * @param {Array<{ completed: boolean }>} tasks
 *   The full task list.
 * @param {boolean} completed
 *   Pass `true` to get only completed tasks; pass `false` for only incomplete tasks.
 * @returns {Array<{ completed: boolean }>}
 *   A new array containing only tasks whose `task.completed` matches the `completed` argument.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Do not mutate the input array.
 * - Keep the original task objects (no copying needed).
 *
 * Example:
 * - filterTasksByStatus(tasks, true)  -> all tasks where completed === true
 * - filterTasksByStatus(tasks, false) -> all tasks where completed === false
