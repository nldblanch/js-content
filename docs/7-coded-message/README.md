# Coded Message

## Before You Start

This challenge introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in JavaScript. You'll learn about classes, methods, and the `this` keyword while working with array methods. If you're new to OOP, the instructions file provides detailed explanations of each concept.

## Objective

Build a `MessageDecoder` class that transforms an encoded array of strings using various array methods to reveal a hidden message about programming. Master OOP principles while practicing array manipulation techniques.

## Learning Goals

- Understand JavaScript classes and constructors
- Practice array methods (`.pop()`, `.push()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`, `.splice()`, `.join()`)
- Learn method chaining with `this`
- Work with instance methods and encapsulation
- Understand the difference between mutating and non-mutating methods

## Note

The `revealSecretMessage()` method has already been written for you. Your task is to implement the individual methods it depends on. Once all methods are correctly implemented, the secret message will be revealed!

You can check your progress at any time:
