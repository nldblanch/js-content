## Before You Start

You may have noticed this new style of function - the arrow function. I have [written a guide](./arrowFunctions.md) on them if you want to read, or you can do your own research. 

## Objective

Write unit tests for prewritten code to validate its functionality, uncover hidden bugs, and strengthen understanding of test-driven development principles. It would be very beneficial for you to read the instructions for this challenge even if you feel confident testing on your own. 

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrate unit testing techniques
- Practice debugging
- Understand expected behaviours

## Note

You can use `jest` in coverage mode to check how robust your tests are! It's not an exact measure of whether you've tested properly, but it can be helpful in catching lines or branches you may have missed.

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
