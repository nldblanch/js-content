# Temperature Converter 

## Objective

Create a temperature converter that can convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Learning Goals

- Work with JavaScript functions and mathematical operations
- Learn to write clean, testable code

## Useful Formulas

- Celsius to Fahrenheit: `(celsius * 9/5) + 32`
- Fahrenheit to Celsius: `(fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Follow the Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Read `instructions.md` for detailed, beginner-friendly instructions
2. Build your solution step by step
3. Test with `npm test` when ready
4. As you progress, remove `.skip` from the `describe` blocks to add more tests.

### Option 2: Practice Test-Driven Development

1. Read the [Function Documentation](#function-documentation) 
2. Write the code to pass the tests
3. Remove `.skip` blocks from `describe` blocks.
4. Add functionality until all tests pass.

## Files in This Challenge

- `instructions.md` - Step-by-step tutorial approach
- `temperature.js` - Your solution file
- `temperature.test.js` - Test suite with incremental challenges

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass
- Functions handle positive and negative temperatures
- Round-trip conversions maintain precision
- Code is clean and readable
