# Rock Paper Scissors

## Objective

Create a console-based Rock Paper Scissors game that accepts user input, generates a computer choice, determines a winner, and logs the results. The implementation should be modular and testable.

## Learning Goals

- Write small, testable JavaScript functions
- Use control flow (if/else, switch) to implement game logic
- Practice input validation and edge-case handling (e.g., cheat codes)

## Notes

- The `playGame` function has already been written for you.
- When you have the tests passing, try running the command `npm run play`.
